# Rain Drops

Rain Drops is a slight variation of the infamous Fizz-Buzz kata.

Program a function that takes a number and return its value as a string.

However, for numbers that are divisible by a certain number,
return one of the following:

|Divisible By|Result|
|------------|------|
|           3|Pling |
|           5|Plang |
|           7|Plong |

Please note that you have to return a combination
of those if the number is divisible by more
than one number.

Examples:

- 2 -> "2"
- 3 -> "Pling"
- 15 -> "PlingPlang"
- 105 -> "PlingPlangPlong"
