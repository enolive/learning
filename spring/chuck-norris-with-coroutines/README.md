# Spring Webflux with Coroutines

This code demonstrates how to use Kotlin Coroutines in a reactive Spring Boot stack.

## Highlights

* testing with kotest
* mocking with mockk
* fully covered code (except the spring boot run method)
* using suspend functions instead of the types from Project Reactor
* mocking a complete server to get deterministic answers for an integration test
* unit testing a web client fetch by completely mocking it
