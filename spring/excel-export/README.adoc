== Details

It basically uses https://poi.apache.org/[Apache POI] for generating the document.
The Controller writes the file into an OutputStream that is asynchronously piped into a flow of data buffers that are served. It also uses a response entity to add some header information about the content type and its disposition as an attachment.

== How to run

Start the application and navigate to http://localhost:8080/export. You should get an Excel file with two rows and and two cells.
